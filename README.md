# Xournal++ Website

This is the repository for the Xournal++ website. A push to the `site` branch
will automatically cause the website to be deployed to `master` branch.

The website is generated by [MkDocs][mkdocs]. If you would like to help revise
the website, feel free to [submit a pull
request](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp.github.io/pulls)!

## How to contribute

If you want to edit a single page individually, just navigate to the page on
GitHub and click the edit button; this will allow you to submit a pull request
(PR). Once you've submitted a PR, a maintainer will look over it and then merge
it after reviewing it and giving some feedback.

### Setting up local web server

If you're editing multiple pages, it might be more useful to preview the site
locally. To do so, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository and navigate inside.
2. If you haven't create a virtualenv, do so by running: `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtualenv: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. If you just created the virtualenv, install the dependencies:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run `mkdocs serve` to start up a webserver that hosts your local version of
   the website, which you can access from `https://localhost:8080`

While developing the website, you may want to refer to the documentation of the dependencies we use:

* [MkDocs][mkdocs]
* [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)
* [macros plugin](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#mkdocs-macros)
